\title{Identify metabolic modules within the biological networks using a consensus clustering approach}
\usage{
clusterNet(object, tau = 0.5, max_iterations = 5, eps_threshold = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{\link{DNEAresults}} object}

\item{tau}{The \% agreement threshold among the clustering algorithms for a node to be included in a subnetwork}

\item{max_iterations}{The maximum number of replicates of the clustering algorithms to perform before consensus is reached}

\item{eps_threshold}{A cut-off value thresholding the adjacency matrix. Edges with a partial correlation value below this
threshold will be removed.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{DNEAresults}} object containing sub-network determinations for the nodes within the input network.
A summary of the consensus clustering results can be viewed using \code{\link{CCsummary}}.
Sub-network membership for each node can be found in the "membership" column of the node list, which can be
viewed using \code{\link{nodeList}}.
}
\description{
This function clusters the jointly estimated adjacency matrix constructed using \code{\link{getNetworks}} via
the consensus clustering approach described in Ma et al (\emph{Please see the \strong{\emph{Details}} section for more
information}) to identify metabolic modules, aka subnetworks, present in the larger networks.
Only subnetworks with consensus that meets or exceeds tau are identified as real.
}
\details{
Seven clustering algorithms from the \code{\link{igraph}} package are utilized in this consensus clustering approach:
\enumerate{
\item \code{\link[igraph:cluster_edge_betweenness]{cluster_edge_betweenness}}
\item \code{\link[igraph:cluster_fast_greedy]{cluster_fast_greedy}}
\item \code{\link[igraph:cluster_infomap]{cluster_infomap}}
\item \code{\link[igraph:cluster_label_prop]{cluster_label_prop}}
\item \code{\link[igraph:cluster_louvain]{cluster_louvain}}
\item \code{\link[igraph:cluster_walktrap]{cluster_walktrap}}
\item \code{\link[igraph:cluster_leading_eigen]{cluster_leading_eigen}}}

For each iteration, node membership in each respective cluster is compared across the algorithms, and only the clusters with \% agreement
greater than tau are kept. A new adjacency graph is then created and clustering is performed again. This occurs iteratively until consensus
on stable subnetworks or the specified max_iterations is reached \emph{(Please see references for more details)}.
}
\examples{
#import completed example data
data(TEDDYresults)

#identify metabolic modules via consensus clustering
TEDDYresults <- clusterNet(object = TEDDYresults, tau = 0.5, max_iterations = 5)

#we can also plot the subnetworks
plotNetworks(object = TEDDYresults, type = "subnetworks", subtype = 1)
