\usage{
tune_init(trainX, model, lambda)

tune_init(trainX, model, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{trainX}{a matrix of expression data wherein the samples are rows and features are columns}

\item{model}{A list of corresponding conditions for the training_data}

\item{lambda}{a vector of supplied lambda values}
}
\value{
A set of variables corresponding to the following variables regarding
the training_data: number of features (p), number of conditions (K), number of lambda
values being tested (N), an a vector containing the number of samples per condition (n),
an initialized vector for BIC scores (BIC_score), an initialized vector for likelihood (likelihood)
