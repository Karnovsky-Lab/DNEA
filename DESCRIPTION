Description: The DNEA R package is the latest implementation of the Differential Network Enrichment Analysis 
             algorithm and is the predecessor to the Filigree Java-application described in Iyer et al. (2020). The package is 
             designed to take as input an m x n expression matrix for some -omics modality (ie. metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, etc.) 
             and jointly estimate the biological network associations of each condition using the DNEA algorithm described in Ma et al. (2019). 
             Consensus clustering is then performed to identify metabolic modules within the larger networks and the netGSA algorithm, described in 
             Hellstern et al. (2021) is used to test the identfied modules for differential enrichment across the two experimental conditions.
