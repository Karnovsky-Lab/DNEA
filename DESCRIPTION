Description: The DNEA R package is the latest implementation of the 
             Differential Network Enrichment Analysis algorithm and 
             is the successor to the Filigree Java-application 
             described in Iyer et al. (2020). The package is designed 
             to take as input an m x n expression matrix for some -omics 
             modality (ie. metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, etc.) 
             and jointly estimate the biological network associations 
             of each condition using the DNEA algorithm described in 
             Ma et al. (2019). This approach provides a framework for 
             data-driven enrichment analysis across two experimental 
             conditions that utilizes the underlying correlation 
             structure of the data to determine feature-feature 
             interactions.
